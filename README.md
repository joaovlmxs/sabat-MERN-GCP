## Introduction

The **sabat-MERN-GCP** project aims to simplify the process of building RESTful APIs with a focus on scalability and performance. It leverages the strengths of the MERN stack, along with the robust capabilities of Google Cloud Platform. This makes it an ideal choice for developers looking to create efficient applications.

## Features

- RESTful API architecture
- Built with Node.js and Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- Easy deployment on Google Cloud Platform
- Swagger UI for API documentation
- PM2 for process management
- Scalable and efficient design

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data in JSON-like documents.
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Suite of cloud computing services.
- **PM2**: Advanced, production process manager for Node.js applications.
